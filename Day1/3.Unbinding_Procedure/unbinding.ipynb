    "\n",
    "Besides binding thermodynamics, binding kinetics are an important aspect of host-guest complexation. Ideal ligands do not only have a favourable binding free energy, but also a considerable residence time, implying it has a high enough reaction barrier to prevent frequent binding events.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike thermodynamics, studying kinetics requires knowledge of the entire path of the process. In this section, we present an adaptive biasing algorithm, designed to acquire unbinding paths of protein-ligand complexes.\n",
